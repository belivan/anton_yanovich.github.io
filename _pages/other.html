<h3> Carpentry </h3>
I have grown up in a family of engineers, carpenters, and jack of all traders. From time to time, I work on carpentry projects. 
The picture shown is a garage door project I completed in Spring 2021, where we designed and constructed a garage door from scratch! 
Going forward, I want to learn to work on cars.

<h3> <a href="photography/"> Photography </a></h3>  
In high school, I invested in a DSLR. Learning to operate a camera and figuring out its components has always interested me. 
Before receiving my camera, I spent hours watching tutorials on digital photography, including both shooting and editing.
I usually bring the camera with me on vacations and trips. I love shooting nature and scenery.

<h3> Art </h3>
When growing up, I enjoyed sketching. I was always amazed by the human ability to draw. 
In elementary school, I participated in a couple of drawing classes. 
Starting with 5th grade, I enrolled in an art program through school, where I would stay for daily after-school drawing sessions. 
After moving to the United States, I continued to practice drawing periodically on my own time and through school courses. 
However, I hope to set aside more time for drawing and developing the skill.

<h3> Small Business </h3> 
In May 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I started a firewood sale in front of my house! 
My family, friends, and I have always enjoyed evening bonfires. In the suburbs of PA, firewood is a demanded item, averaging $10 per bundle at retail stores. 
Setting up a table, I was uncertain of the success; however, each day had been bringing in a sale! 
I managed the sourcing, processing, and packaging of wood. 
The business operated until university classes returned to in-person mode in September 2021.
