        <h4 class="project-title"> Cardiovascular flow analysis with MTV</h4>
        <p><strong>Jun. 2021 – Present </strong>: Over the last two summers, I have assisted Dr. Kartik Bulusu with cardiovascular research and implementing the MTV experimental technique to extract high-precision fluid flow data from a human artery model. 
          I made contributions through a review of recent relevant literature and the preparation and execution of experiments. 
          In October 2022, in collaboration with Charles Fort and his group, we collected initial experimental data on the subject of MTV to Measure Wall Shear Stress in Model Cardiovascular Flows. 
          I had an opportunity to attend  APS 2022 Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis, IN, where we presented our progress. </p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Delivery drone charging system</h4>
        <p><strong>Jan. 2022 – Present </strong>: In 2022, I had an opportunity to intern at a start-up, Drone Point Solutions LLC, to design a drone charging system specifically designed for package delivery drones. 
          I researched innovations and standard practices regarding battery charging and energy management. Relevant topics also included the configuration of EV charging systems and cars. As a result, 
          I learned about battery management techniques, battery technology, and charging systems.</p>

              <p><strong>Nov. 2021 and Nov. 2022</strong>: My team and I participated in two of the Pitch George Competitions. 
                In November 2021, we entered the competition with a public health-oriented proposition and became one of the competition’s finalists. 
                In November 2022, we pitched “SecuFoam” (Capstone Design Project) and successfully advanced onto the second but not the final competition stage. </p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> I-Corps</h4>
            <p><strong>Oct. 2022 - Nov. 2022</strong>:  With the “SecuFoam” project team, we entered the GWU I-Corps 2-week program to help advance the conceptual idea and gain valuable experience for establishing a business venture. 
              I learned about the customer discovery process and strategy. We conducted over 20 interviews with public health officials, managers, and students at GWU and GW Hospital. 
              We are interested in continuing the program and potentially pursuing the national-scale I-Corps program. </p>

          <p><strong>Oct. 2021 - Present </strong>: Since the Fall of 2021, I have been privileged to lead GWU’s ASME section as the Section Chair. 
            With the executive board, we have been managing the organization, including activities and events, and recruitment. 
            We have aimed to make ASME a community for mechanical engineers and engineers at large to learn, help each other, and exchange experiences.  </p>
