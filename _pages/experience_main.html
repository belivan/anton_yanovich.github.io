        <h4 class="project-title"> Cardiovascular flow analysis with MTV</h4>
        <p><strong>Jun. 2021 – Present </strong>: Over the last two summers, I have assisted Dr. Kartik Bulusu with cardiovascular research and implementing the MTV experimental technique 
          to extract high precision fluid flow data of a human artery. I made contributions though review of recent relevant literature and preparation and execution of experiments. 
          In addition, though Python, I compiled and created graphical representations of datasets. 
          In October 2022, in collaboration with Charles Fort and his group, we have collected initial experimental data on the subject of …. , 
          and I had an opportunity to attend  APS 2022 Fluid Dynamics in Indianapolis, IN where we presented our progress. </p>
      
        <h4 class="project-title"> Delivery drone charging system</h4>
        <p><strong>Jan. 2022 – Present </strong>: Over 2022, I had an opportunity to intern in a start-up Drone Point Solutions LLC to design a drone charging system specifically designed for package delivery drones. 
          I researched innovations and common practices regarding battery charging and energy management. 
          Relevant topics also included configuration of EV charging systems and cars. As result, I learned about battery management techniques, battery technology, and charging systems.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Pitch George 2021 & 2022</h4>
        <p><strong>Nov. 2021 and Nov. 2022</strong>: My team and I participated in two of the Pitch George Competitions. 
          In November 2021, we entered the competition with a public health-oriented proposition and become one of the competition’s finalists.
          In November 2022, we pitched “SecuFoam” (Capstone Design Project) and successfully advanced onto the second but not to the final competition stage. </p>
      
        <h4 class="project-title"> I-Corps</h4>
        <p><strong>Oct. 2022 - Nov. 2022</strong>:  With the SecuFoam project team, 
          we entered the GWU I-Corps 2-week program to help advance the conceptual idea and gain valuable experience for establishment of a business venture. 
          I learned about the customer discovery process and strategy. 
          We conducted over 20 interviews with public health officials, managers, and students at GWU and GW Hospital. We are interested in continuing the program and potentially pursuing the national scale I-Corps program. </p>
