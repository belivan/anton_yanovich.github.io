        <h4 class="project-title">Autonomous Off-road Navigation</h4>
        <p><strong>Oct. 2023 – Present</strong>: I excited to contribute to the <a href="https://theairlab.org/offroad/">TartanDrive</a> project at AirLab (Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University), where we are developing an autonomous all-terrain vehicle that can navigate in challenging environments.
          My role includes integrating thermal imaging into vehicle's systems and developing learning-based visual and perception models to enhance navigation precision.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title">Cardiovascular Flow Analysis with MTV</h4>
        <p><strong>Jun. 2021 – Aug. 2023</strong>: For three summers, I assisted <a href="https://gwu.academia.edu/KartikBulusu">Dr. Kartik Bulusu</a> in cardiovascular research at <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Biofluid-Dynamics-Lab-Michael-W-Plesniak">Biofluid Dynamics Laboratory</a>. 
          We applied MTV techniques to analyze fluid flow in human artery models. 
          My role included leading the design and preparation of experiments. 
          In collaboration with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Fort">Dr. Charles Fort</a>, 
          we gathered initial data on 'MTV to Measure Wall Shear Stress in Model Cardiovascular Flows' in October 2022. 
          I also presented our findings at the <a href="https://www.apsdfd2022.org/">APS 2022 Fluid Dynamics</a> conference in Indianapolis, IN.</p>
