        <h4 class="project-title"> Cardiovascular flow analysis with MTV</h4>
        <p><strong>Jun. 2021 – Present </strong>: Over the last two summers, I have assisted <a href="https://www.seas.gwu.edu/kartik-v-bulusu">Dr. Kartik Bulusu</a>  with cardiovascular research and implementing the MTV experimental technique to extract high-precision fluid flow data from a human artery model. 
          I made contributions through a review of recent relevant literature and the preparation and execution of experiments. 
          In October 2022, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Charles-Fort">Dr. Charles Fort</a> and his group, we collected initial experimental data on the subject of MTV to Measure Wall Shear Stress in Model Cardiovascular Flows. 
          I had an opportunity to attend  <a href="https://www.apsdfd2022.org/">APS 2022 Fluid Dynamics</a> conference in Indianapolis, IN, where we presented our progress. </p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Delivery drone charging system</h4>
        <p><strong>Jan. 2022 – Present </strong>: In 2022, I had an opportunity to intern at a start-up, <a href="https://dronepointsolutions.com/">Drone Point Solutions, LLC.</a>, to design a drone charging system specifically designed for package delivery drones. 
          I researched innovations and standard practices regarding battery charging and energy management. Relevant topics also included the configuration of EV charging systems and cars. As a result, 
          I learned about battery management techniques, battery technology, and charging systems.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> New Venture Competition</h4>
              <p><strong>Feb. - Apr. 2023</strong>: The George Washington University’s <a href ="https://newventurecompetition.gwu.edu/">New Venture Competition</a> is the <u>#1 largest collegiate</u> competition in the country. 
                Our team, SecuFoam, has made a first-round submission and is competing in the Health & Life Sciences track (as of 01/29/2023). 
                The IoT-based product SecuFoam is meant to equip large institutions with tools to prevent and track the spread of common illnesses. 
                As a team of multidisciplinary engineers, 
                we are excited for an opportunity to put forth a venture proposal and make a contribution to public health.</p>

              <p><strong>Nov. 2021 and Nov. 2022</strong>: My team and I participated in two of <a href="https://business.gwu.edu/pitch-george">the Pitch George Competitions</a>. 
                In November 2021, we entered the competition with a public health-oriented proposition and became one of the competition’s finalists. 
                In November 2022, we pitched “SecuFoam” (Capstone Design Project) and successfully advanced onto the second but not the final competition stage. </p>

            <p><strong>Oct. 2022 - Nov. 2022</strong>:  With the “SecuFoam” project team, we entered the <em>GWU I-Corps</em> <u>2-week</u> program to help advance the conceptual idea and gain valuable experience for establishing a business venture. 
              I learned about the customer discovery process and strategy. We conducted over 20 interviews with public health officials, managers, and students at <em>GWU</em> and <em>GW Hospital</em>. 
              We are interested in continuing the program and potentially pursuing the national-scale <a href="https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/i-corps">I-Corps</a> program. </p>

          <p><strong>Oct. 2021 - Present </strong>: Since the Fall of 2021, I have been privileged to lead GWU’s <a href="https://www.asme.org/">ASME</a> section as the Section Chair. 
            With the executive board, we have been managing the organization, including activities and events, and recruitment. 
            We have aimed to make ASME a community for mechanical engineers and engineers at large to learn, help each other, and exchange experiences.  </p>
