        <p><strong>Oct. 2023</strong>: For my individual mini-project, I created my first complete C/C++ game program (around 2500 lines of code). 
          I used <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">openGL</a> library to create a 2D game where the user can interact 
            with the environment and sand particles against a programmed CPU. The game incorporates simple physics of sand particles, as well as a music player 
            that is incorporated into the gaming logic!</p>

        <div class = "unit two-thirds">
        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – May 2023</strong>: This was an exciting project and experience where 
          I partnered with students from other engineering disciplines at GWU’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
          We worked together to develop hardware and software that can work simultaneously to improve the quality and access 
          to information regarding public health in any given setting, such as a university. We successfully utilized and interconnected 
          technologies such as <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a>, 
          and <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/AWS">AWS</a> to achieve our objective. 
          Additionally, I gained significant experience where we tried our product commercially by making proposals at 
          university-sponsored programs such as <a href="https://business.gwu.edu/pitch-george">GWU Pitch George</a> 
          and <em>GW I-Corps</em>, <em>the New Venture Competition</em> to present our project!</p>

        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Dec. 2022</strong>: During my studies at GWU, it was a pleasure to be in a Product Management course, taught by Dr. Johan Ferreira at GWU’s Business School. 
          I had an opportunity to extensively learn about the product development process from the ground up. 
          As result, in a group we developed a product “proposal” for Equinox in which we discussed the market opportunity, financial feasibility, and marketing approach.</p>

        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Dec. 2022</strong>: For another academic project, we were tasked to create an enviro-friendly and hydrogen fuel compatible redesign of GWU’s Science and Engineering Hall’s thermal system, including the air-conditioning, heating, and power generation for the building. 
          I learned a great deal about advantages, drawbacks, and environmental impact of commonly used system configurations across the industry.</p>

        <p><strong>Sept. 2021 – Dec. 2021</strong>: For one of the academic projects, we were tasked to apply the knowledge of machining equipment and techniques. 
          Our team chose to recreate a screwdriver from scratch. 
          In addition, the purpose of the project was for the students to able to create and execute a process plan which outlined the raw materials, 
          machines to be used and their sequence, fixturing devices needed, cutters needed, deburring and cleaning processes, 
          inspection process, assembly process, and anything else that was anticipated to go into the manufacturing process</p>

        <div class="grid">
        <div clas="unit two-thirds">
        <p><strong>Jan. 2021 – March. 2021</strong>: As part of the annual international <a href =" https://www.aiaa.org/dbf">AIAA Design/Build/Fly</a> competition, 
          the George University built a remote controlled (RC) aircraft that can also execute specific functions.  
          However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our design team was forced to operate from home with limited ability to meet and work as a team. 
          Yet, we successfully designed an aircraft, and we finally were able to meet and bring design to life. 
          I contributed to manufacturing individual parts and assembly of a prototype plane. 
          The design was a success and the team scored high in the international competition, placing 4th in the US and 6th in the world against over 200 teams!</p>
