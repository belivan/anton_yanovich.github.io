            <p><strong>Apr. 2024 – May 2024</strong>: During the Robot Learning course, this group project focuses on enhancing the capabilities of humanoid robots 
            through machine learning architectures. Utilizing the <a href="https://humanoid-bench.github.io/">Humanoid-Bench</a> framework, 
            we have significantly improved the TDMPC2 algorithm with decision transformers, 
            reducing training times by 66% without sacrificing performance. 
            We explored the potential of further replacing MLPs with transformers to further increase efficiency, as well as applying the approach to other robust algorithms 
            such as the DreamerV3 platform. The project primarily deals with a humanoid robot performing a 'sit' task, simulated in MuJoCo.

            and during the Advanced Engineering Computations (C/C++) course,
            I have developed an efficient C++ adaptation of the MPPI control framework, 
            achieving a 50% increase in computational speed. 
            This project also involves implementing the algorithm with LibTorch and GPU support, 
            enhancing processing capabilities and conducting simulations with replay data to ensure robust decision-making
            and improve vehicle dynamics under various conditions.</p>

        <p><strong>Oct. 2023</strong>: For my individual mini-project, I created my first complete C/C++ game program (around 2500 lines of code). 
          I used <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">openGL</a> library to create a 2D game where the user can interact 
            with the environment and sand psections against a programmed CPU. The game incorporates simple physics of sand psections, as well as a music player

        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – May 2023</strong>: This was an exciting project and experience where 
          I partnered with students from other engineering disciplines at GWU’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
          We worked together to develop hardware and software that can work simultaneously to improve the quality and access 
          to information regarding public health in any given setting, such as a university. We successfully utilized and interconnected 
          technologies such as <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a>, 
          and <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/AWS">AWS</a> to achieve our objective. 
          Additionally, I gained significant experience where we tried our product commercially by making proposals at 
          university-sponsored programs such as <a href="https://business.gwu.edu/pitch-george">GWU Pitch George</a> 
          and <em>GW I-Corps</em>, <em>the New Venture Competition</em> to present our project!</p>

        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Dec. 2022</strong>: During my studies at GWU, it was a pleasure to be in a Product Management course, taught by Dr. Johan Ferreira at GWU’s Business School. 
          I had an opportunity to extensively learn about the product development process from the ground up. 
          As result, in a group we developed a product “proposal” for Equinox in which we discussed the market opportunity, financial feasibility, and marketing approach.</p>

          Our team chose to recreate a screwdriver from scratch. 
          In addition, the purpose of the project was for the students to able to create and execute a process plan which outlined the raw materials,

          the George University built a remote controlled (RC) aircraft that can also execute specific functions.  
          However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our design team was forced to operate from home with limited ability to meet and work as a team. 
          Yet, we successfully designed an aircraft, and we finally were able to meet and bring design to life. 
          I contributed to manufacturing individual parts and assembly of a prototype plane. 
          The design was a success and the team scored high in the international competition, placing 4th in the US and 6th in the world against over 200 teams!</p>
