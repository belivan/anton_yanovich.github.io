        <h4 class="project-title"> Capstone Design Project: SecuFoam </h4>
        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Present </strong>: This has been an exciting project and experience where I have partnered with students from other engineering disciplines at GWU’s School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
          We have been working together to develop a sanitizing dispenser and a mobile app that will work simultaneously to improve the quality and access to information regarding public health at any given setting, such as a university. 
          We hope to successfully utilize and interconnect technologies such as Arduino, LoRa, and AWS to achieve our objective. 
          Additionally, I have gained great experience where we have been testing our product commercially through making proposals at university sponsored programs such as GWU Pitch George and GW I-Corps. 
          We are also looking forward to competing in GWU’s largest program, the New Venture Competition, to present and further develop our concept!</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Product Development: Equinox Nourish  </h4>
        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Dec. 2022 </strong>: Last semester (Fall 2022), it was a pleasure to be in the graduate-level Product Management course, taught by Dr. Johan Ferreira at GWU’s Business School. 
          I had an opportunity to extensively learn about the product development process from the ground up. 
          As result, in a group we developed a product “proposal” for Equinox in which we discussed the market opportunity, financial feasibility, and marketing approach.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Thermal Systems Design: Science and Engineering Hall </h4>
        <p><strong>Sept. 2022 – Dec. 2022 </strong>: For another academic project, we were tasked to create an enviro-friendly and hydrogen fuel compatible redesign of GWU’s Science and Engineering Hall’s thermal system, including the air-conditioning, heating, and power generation for the building. 
          I learned a great deal about advantages, drawbacks, and environmental impact of commonly used system configurations across the industry.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Manufacturing Project </h4>
        <p><strong>Sept. 2021 – Dec. 2021 </strong>: For one of the academic projects, we were tasked to apply the knowledge of machining equipment and techniques. 
          Our team chose to recreate a screwdriver from scratch. 
          In addition, the purpose of the project was for the students to able to create and execute a process plan which outlined the raw materials, 
          machines to be used and their sequence, fixturing devices needed, cutters needed, deburring and cleaning processes, 
          inspection process, assembly process, and anything else that was anticipated to go into the manufacturing process</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"> Design/Build/Fly 2021</h4>
        <p><strong>Jan. 2021 – March. 2021 </strong>: As part of the annual international AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition, the George University participated in remote controlled (RC) aircraft that can also execute specific functions.  
          However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our design team was forced to operate from home with limited ability to meet and work as a team. 
          Yet, we successfully designed an aircraft, and we finally were able to meet and bring design to life. 
          I contributed to manufacturing individual parts and assembly of the plane. 
          The design was a success and the team scored high in the international competition, placing 4th in the US and 6th in the world against over 200 teams! </p>
