Hello, my name is Anton! I am a mechanical engineering and business student at George Washington University (GWU) in Washington, DC. I am from Minsk, Belarus, and live in Pittsburgh, PA! I am an undergraduate student with broad interests and a diverse skill set. As a student, I have an interest in mechatronics and energy. I am especially motivated by subjects such as autonomous and sustainable systems. I am considering continuing my education by pursuing a master’s degree in dynamics and control systems. Aside from my deep technical passion, I have been intrigued by innovation and product management. I aspire to one day work in the automotive sector to develop next-generation vehicles for a cleaner and safer world.

In May 2023, I will be graduating with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor in Business. I have taken coursework across various disciplines under the mechanical engineering umbrella, including biomechanics and robotics. Additionally, I have had an opportunity to take courses at GWU’s Business School covering financial, strategic, and managerial aspects of business operations.

Among my experiences, I have been privileged to work as a research assistant in the GWU Biofluid Dynamics Laboratory for the last two years. In addition, I have worked with a start-up, Drone Point Solutions as a project intern. Moreover, I am collaborating with a team of interdisciplinary engineering students on a Capstone project.

<!-- and want to be like Anton Egorov who is a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in computer vision (3D point cloud semantic segmentation) and deep learning for robust 3D perception. I am also broadly interested in SLAM.

I am currently a Data Scientist (ML Matching Team) at [OZON](https://corp.ozon.com/) Technology in Russia. Prior to this role, I served as Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group in the same company. I have been working on developing of algorithms that underlie SLAM.

From August 2020 to June 2021, I was a doctaral student at [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) of [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) with [*Professor Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my <strong>Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems</strong> at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 — including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My Master's research work was based at [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [*Professor Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en) — related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm with an orientation-invariant property
