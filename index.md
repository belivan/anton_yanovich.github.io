Hello I'm Anton Yanovich, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), specializing in robotics and automation. Following my undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering and business at George Washington University, my academic and professional journey has now led me to delve deeper into the fields of robotics and machine learning

In May 2024, I am set to graduate from CMU with a wealth of knowledge and practical experience gained through a rigorous curriculum. Moreover, I am currently working as a Research Assistant at [AirLab] (https://theairlab.org/), exploring the navigation of [autonomous all-terrain vehicles](https://theairlab.org/offroad/). My studies and experiences have equipped me to apply my expertise in robotics and automation to a wide range of industries. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills to solve diverse and complex problems. The versatility of robotics and its transformative potential across various sectors is what drives my personal and professional aspirations.


<!-- and want to be like Anton Egorov who is a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in computer vision (3D point cloud semantic segmentation) and deep learning for robust 3D perception. I am also broadly interested in SLAM.

I am currently a Data Scientist (ML Matching Team) at [OZON](https://corp.ozon.com/) Technology in Russia. Prior to this role, I served as Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group in the same company. I have been working on developing of algorithms that underlie SLAM.

From August 2020 to June 2021, I was a doctaral student at [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) of [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) with [*Professor Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my <strong>Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems</strong> at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 — including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My Master's research work was based at [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [*Professor Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en) — related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm with an orientation-invariant property
