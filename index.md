Hello, I'm Anton Yanovich, and I am currently pursuing my <strong>Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering</strong> at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), specializing in <strong>robotics and automation</strong>. Following my undergraduate studies in <strong>Mechanical Engineering and Business</strong> at George Washington University, my academic and professional journey has now led me to delve deeper into the fields of robotics and machine learning.

In May 2024, I am set to graduate from CMU with advanced knowledge and practical experience gained through extensive project and research experience. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/), exploring the navigation of [autonomous all-terrain vehicles](https://theairlab.org/offroad/). My research involves developing and implementing control algorithms, thermal imaging, and generative models. My studies and experiences have equipped me to apply my expertise in robotics and automation to a wide range of industries. I am enthusiastic about solving diverse and complex problems. The versatility of robotics and its transformative potential across various sectors is what drives my personal and professional aspirations.


<!-- and want to be like Anton Egorov who is a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in computer vision (3D point cloud semantic segmentation) and deep learning for robust 3D perception. I am also broadly interested in SLAM.

I am currently a Data Scientist (ML Matching Team) at [OZON](https://corp.ozon.com/) Technology in Russia. Prior to this role, I served as Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group in the same company. I have been working on developing of algorithms that underlie SLAM.

From August 2020 to June 2021, I was a doctaral student at [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) of [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) with [*Professor Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my <strong>Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems</strong> at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 — including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My Master's research work was based at [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [*Professor Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en) — related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm with an orientation-invariant property
