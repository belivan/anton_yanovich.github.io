Hello, my name is Anton! I am a mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I am from Minsk, Belarus, and have grown up in Pittsburgh, PA. I am a graduate student with broad interests and a diverse skill set. I have an interest in various subjects ranging from robotics to energy. I am pursuing a master’s degree with a focus on control systems and robotics. Aside from my deep technical passion, I have been intrigued by entrepreneurship, innovation and product management. I aspire to one day work in the automotive or aerospace sector to develop next-generation transportation for a cleaner and safer world.

In May 2024, I will be graduating with a M.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I plan to explore and currently taking coursework on topics including Robotic and Vehicle Controls, AI/ML, and Computer Vision. During my time at <a> <href="https://www.gwu.edu/">George Washignton University</a>, where I graduated with B.S in Mechanical Engineering and Minor in Business, I have taken coursework across various disciplines under the mechanical engineering umbrella, including biomechanics and robotics. Additionally, I have had an opportunity to take courses at GWU’s Business School covering financial, strategic, and managerial aspects of business operations.

Among my experiences, I have been privileged to work as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Biofluid-Dynamics-Lab-Michael-W-Plesniak">GWU Biofluid Dynamics Laboratory</a> for the last two years. In addition, I have worked with a start-up, <a href="https://dronepointsolutions.com/">Drone Point Solutions</a> as a product engineering intern. Moreover, I collaborated with a team of interdisciplinary engineering students on a Capstone project, through which I had extensive engineering and business learning opportunities.

<!-- and want to be like Anton Egorov who is a researcher in autonomous robotics with a particular interest in computer vision (3D point cloud semantic segmentation) and deep learning for robust 3D perception. I am also broadly interested in SLAM.

I am currently a Data Scientist (ML Matching Team) at [OZON](https://corp.ozon.com/) Technology in Russia. Prior to this role, I served as Middle Software Developer (Localization and Mapping (SLAM) team) in Self-Driving Group in the same company. I have been working on developing of algorithms that underlie SLAM.

From August 2020 to June 2021, I was a doctaral student at [Autonomous Transportation Systems Lab](https://robotics.innopolis.university/en/labs/laboratoriya-avtonomnyh-transportnyh-sistem/) of [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/en/) with [*Professor Alexandr Klimchik*](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=KLpMBj0AAAAJ&hl=en). I received my <strong>Master of Science in Space and Engineering Systems</strong> at [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](https://www.skoltech.ru/en/) in June 2020 — including a six-month research visit at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My Master's research work was based at [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University under the supervision of [*Professor Howie Choset*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4fvo61oAAAAJ&hl=en) — related to the development of a new 3D Place Recognition framework in 3D LiDAR-based SLAM algorithm with an orientation-invariant property
